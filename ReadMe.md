## Configuration and Setup

### Environment Variables
```bash
GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
```

### Dependencies
- `google.adk.agents`: Core agent framework
- `google.adk.tools`: Tool integrations
- `pydantic`: Data validation
- `python-dotenv`: Environment management

### Model Configuration
- **Default Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash`
- **Fallback**: Environment variable override support

## Quality Control System

### Quality Assessment Process
1. **Automatic Evaluation**: Each agent output is automatically assessed
2. **Threshold Checking**: Results compared against agent-specific thresholds
3. **Retry Logic**: Failed outputs trigger instruction enhancement and retry
4. **Metadata Addition**: Quality scores attached to state for downstream use

### Quality Metrics
- **Length-based Scoring**: Initial implementation uses output length as quality proxy
- **Issue Detection**: Identifies common problems (e.g., insufficient detail)
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides specific enhancement recommendations

## Conditional Orchestration

### Decision Points
1. **Competitive Analysis**: Triggered by competitor mentions in market research
2. **Messaging Refinement**: Based on quality score thresholds
3. **Phase Skipping**: Allows workflow optimization based on context

### Orchestration Logic
- **Keyword Detection**: Simple heuristics for competitive analysis trigger
- **Quality Gates**: Threshold-based decision making
- **State Evaluation**: Context-aware workflow adaptation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Initialize the system
root_agent = CampaignOrchestrator()

# Execute campaign development
result = await root_agent.execute("AI-powered fitness tracker")

# Access results
final_strategy = result['final_campaign_strategy']
market_research = result['market_research_summary']
```

### Quality Monitoring
```python
# Check quality scores
quality_score = result.get('market_research_summary_quality')
if quality_score.score < 0.7:
    print(f"Quality issues: {quality_score.issues}")
    print(f"Suggestions: {quality_score.suggestions}")
```

## Extension Points

### Adding New Agents
1. Create new MarketingAgent instance
2. Define instruction and output key
3. Set appropriate quality threshold
4. Integrate into phase structure

### Custom Tools
1. Implement tool interface
2. Add to ToolRegistry
3. Assign to relevant agents

### Quality Metrics
1. Override `_assess_quality` method
2. Implement domain-specific scoring
3. Define custom thresholds

## Performance Considerations

### Retry Strategy
- **Maximum Retries**: 2 attempts per agent
- **Quality-Based Triggering**: Retries only when quality threshold not met
- **Instruction Enhancement**: Dynamic prompt improvement based on quality issues
- **Exponential Backoff**: Not implemented (future enhancement)

### Tool Usage Optimization
- **Research Tools**: Strategic use limited to research and competitive analysis phases
- **Rate Limiting**: Handled by underlying ADK framework
- **Caching**: Not implemented (future enhancement opportunity)
- **API Efficiency**: Conditional tool usage based on workflow needs

### Temperature Control Impact
- **Consistency vs Creativity**: 0.3 temperature balances reliability with useful variation
- **Response Time**: Lower temperature generally reduces inference time
- **Token Efficiency**: More predictable output lengths reduce costs
- **Quality Predictability**: Consistent outputs enable better quality assessment

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Campaign Generation
```python
# Initialize the system
root_agent = CampaignOrchestrator()

# Execute campaign development
result = await root_agent.execute("AI-powered fitness tracker")

# Access comprehensive results
final_strategy = result['final_campaign_strategy']
market_research = result['market_research_summary']
competitive_analysis = result['competitive_analysis']
messaging = result['strategic_messaging']
copy_variations = result['multi_channel_copy']
visual_concepts = result['visual_strategy']
```

### Quality Monitoring
```python
# Check quality scores across all agents
quality_scores = {
    key: value for key, value in result.items() 
    if key.endswith('_quality')
}

# Identify quality issues
for agent, quality in quality_scores.items():
    if quality.score < 0.7:
        print(f"Quality concerns in {agent}:")
        print(f"Issues: {quality.issues}")
        print(f"Suggestions: {quality.suggestions}")
```

### Conditional Workflow Analysis
```python
# Check if competitive analysis was triggered
if 'competitive_analysis' in result:
    print("Competitive analysis was performed")
    print(f"Competitors identified: {result['competitive_analysis']}")
else:
    print("Competitive analysis was skipped")
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash

# Optional (with defaults)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Agent Configuration
```python
# Custom quality thresholds
market_research_agent = MarketingAgent(
    name="CustomMarketResearcher",
    instruction=MARKET_RESEARCH_INSTRUCTION,
    output_key="market_research_summary",
    tools=ToolRegistry.get_research_tools(),
    quality_threshold=0.9  # Higher threshold for critical research
)
```

## Extension Points

### Adding New Agents
```python
# Create new specialized agent
social_media_agent = MarketingAgent(
    name="SocialMediaSpecialist",
    instruction=SOCIAL_MEDIA_INSTRUCTION,
    output_key="social_media_strategy",
    quality_threshold=0.8
)

# Integrate into workflow
strategy_phase = SequentialAgent(
    name="StrategyPhase",
    sub_agents=[
        messaging_strategist_agent,
        multi_channel_copy_agent,
        social_media_agent,  # New agent
        visual_suggester_agent
    ]
)
```

### Custom Tool Integration
```python
# Create custom tool
def custom_market_tool():
    # Implementation
    pass

# Add to registry
class ExtendedToolRegistry(ToolRegistry):
    @staticmethod
    def get_advanced_research_tools():
        return [
            google_search,
            custom_market_tool  # New tool
        ]
```

### Quality Metric Customization
```python
# Override quality assessment
class AdvancedMarketingAgent(MarketingAgent):
    async def _assess_quality(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> QualityScore:
        output = state.get(self.output_key, "")
        
        # Custom quality metrics
        word_count = len(output.split())
        source_count = output.count('[source:')
        
        # Weighted scoring
        score = (word_count / 500) * 0.6 + (source_count / 3) * 0.4
        
        return QualityScore(
            score=min(1.0, score),
            issues=self._identify_custom_issues(output),
            suggestions=self._generate_custom_suggestions(output)
        )
```
