## Configuration

### Environment Setup

```python
# Environment variable loading with fallback mechanism
try:
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    MODEL_NAME = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL", "gemini-2.0-flash")
except ImportError:
    print("Warning: python-dotenv not installed. Ensure API key is set")
    MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.0-flash"
```

**Environment Variables:**
- `GOOGLE_GENAI_MODEL`: Specifies the Google Generative AI model (default: "gemini-2.0-flash")

## Core Components

### 1. Quality Assessment System

#### QualityThreshold Enum
```python
class QualityThreshold(Enum):
    LOW = 0.4
    MEDIUM = 0.7
    HIGH = 0.9
```

**Purpose**: Defines standardized quality thresholds for different quality levels across the system.

#### QualityScore Dataclass
```python
@dataclass
class QualityScore:
    score: float
    issues: List[str]
    suggestions: List[str]
```

**Purpose**: Structured representation of quality assessment results including quantitative score and qualitative feedback.

### 2. ToolRegistry Class

A utility class that manages tool integrations for the agents.

```python
class ToolRegistry:
    @staticmethod
    def get_research_tools():
        return [google_search]
```

**Purpose**: Centralizes tool management and makes it easy to add new tools or modify existing ones.

**Methods**:
- `get_research_tools()`: Returns a list of research-related tools (currently includes Google Search)

### 3. MarketingAgent Class

An enhanced LLM agent that extends the base `LlmAgent` class with quality assessment, retry logic, and marketing-specific configurations.

```python
class MarketingAgent(LlmAgent):
    _quality_threshold: float = PrivateAttr()
    _max_retries: int = PrivateAttr(default=2)
    _retry_count: int = PrivateAttr(default=0)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Quality Assessment**: Built-in quality scoring mechanism
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with enhanced instructions
- **Private Attributes**: Uses Pydantic private attributes for internal state management

**Parameters**:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the agent
- `instruction`: System prompt/instruction for the agent's behavior
- `output_key`: Key used to store the agent's output in the workflow
- `tools`: Optional list of tools the agent can use
- `quality_threshold`: Minimum quality score required (default: 0.7)

**Key Methods**:

#### execute_with_quality_check()
```python
async def execute_with_quality_check(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute with built-in quality assessment and retry logic"""
    for attempt in range(self._max_retries + 1):
        result_state = await self.execute(state)
        quality_score = await self._assess_quality(result_state)
        
        if quality_score.score >= self._quality_threshold or attempt == self._max_retries:
            result_state[f"{self.output_key}_quality"] = quality_score
            return result_state
        
        self.instruction = self._enhance_instruction_for_retry(quality_score)
    
    return result_state
```

**Purpose**: Executes the agent with automatic quality assessment and retry logic.

#### _assess_quality()
```python
async def _assess_quality(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> QualityScore:
    """Simple quality assessment based on output length and content"""
    output = state.get(self.output_key, "")
    score = min(1.0, len(output) / 500)  # Basic length-based scoring
    issues = []
    suggestions = []
    
    if len(output) < 100:
        issues.append("Output too short")
        suggestions.append("Provide more detailed analysis")
    
    return QualityScore(score=score, issues=issues, suggestions=suggestions)
```

**Purpose**: Provides basic quality assessment with extensible framework for more sophisticated evaluation.

#### _enhance_instruction_for_retry()
```python
def _enhance_instruction_for_retry(self, quality_score: QualityScore) -> str:
    """Dynamic prompt enhancement based on quality issues"""
    enhancement = f"\n\nPREVIOUS ATTEMPT HAD ISSUES: {', '.join(quality_score.issues)}"
    enhancement += f"\nIMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS: {', '.join(quality_score.suggestions)}"
    enhancement += "\nPlease address these issues in your response."
    return self.instruction + enhancement
```

**Purpose**: Dynamically enhances agent instructions based on quality assessment feedback.

### 4. ConditionalOrchestrator Class

```python
class ConditionalOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.quality_gate = QualityThreshold.MEDIUM.value
        
    async def should_run_competitive_analysis(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Decide if competitive analysis is needed based on market research"""
        market_research = state.get('market_research_summary', '')
        return any(word in market_research.lower() for word in ['competitor', 'competition', 'rival', 'market leader'])
    
    async def should_refine_messaging(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Check if messaging needs refinement based on quality scores"""
        quality_score = state.get('strategic_messaging_quality', QualityScore(0.5, [], []))

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Quality Assessment Mechanism

The system implements a comprehensive quality assurance framework:

1. **Threshold-Based Evaluation**: Each agent has configurable quality thresholds
2. **Automatic Retry Logic**: Failed quality checks trigger automatic retries
3. **Dynamic Instruction Enhancement**: Retry attempts include enhanced instructions based on quality feedback
4. **Quality Metadata**: Quality scores and feedback are preserved in the workflow state

### Quality Scoring Algorithm

Current implementation uses length-based scoring with extensible framework:

```python
score = min(1.0, len(output) / 500)  # Basic length-based scoring
```

**Extension Points**:
- Content relevance scoring
- Factual accuracy verification
- Brand consistency checks
- Channel optimization validation

### Retry Strategy

- **Maximum Retries**: 2 attempts per agent (configurable)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each retry includes specific feedback from quality assessment
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues even if quality thresholds aren't met after max retries

## Conditional Logic Framework

### Adaptive Workflow Execution

The system includes sophisticated conditional logic to adapt workflow based on intermediate results:

#### Competitive Analysis Trigger
```python
async def should_run_competitive_analysis(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    market_research = state.get('market_research_summary', '')
    return any(word in market_research.lower() for word in ['competitor', 'competition', 'rival', 'market leader'])
```

**Logic**: Competitive analysis phase only executes if market research identifies competitive elements.

#### Messaging Refinement Trigger
```python
async def should_refine_messaging(self, state: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    quality_score = state.get('strategic_messaging_quality', QualityScore(0.5, [], []))
    return quality_score.score < self.quality_gate
```

**Logic**: Additional messaging refinement based on quality assessment results.
